Algorithms 

After completing this course, I can:

-Calculate the asymptotic running time of standard algorithms.
-Explain the meaning of Big-O, Theta, and Omega notations and use them to reason about the performance of diverse algorithms.
-Use the Master Theorem to prove asymptotic assumptions.
-Implement standard algorithms using graphs and weighted graphs in C++ (e.g. DFS, BFS, MST, topological sort).
-Compare and analyze basic and advanced sorting algorithms.
-Implement advanced search trees such as B-tree, AVL tree, 2-3 tree and red-black tree.
-Implement numerical algorithms such as the sieve of Erastosthenes, Gaussian elimination, binary exponentiation, Horner's method, and the simplex method.
-Apply standard algorithm design techniques such as the greedy technique, dynamic programming, hashing, space/time trade-offs, reduction, backtracking, and branch-and-bound.
-Design and implement a test plan for each assignment.
